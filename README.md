# CS2550-Anti-Virus
Basic signature-based malware detection (for CS2550, Spring 18)

Given half of a set of malicious binaries, and half of a set of benign binaries, the assignment was to write a program which could determine whether an unknown binary (from the other half of the data set) was malicious or benign.

This program uses basic string-matching to achieve over 90% accuracy on the unknown binaries.

The assignment ended there, but it sparked my curiousity for exploring new ways to detect malicious binaries, using somewhat more sophisticated methods.
